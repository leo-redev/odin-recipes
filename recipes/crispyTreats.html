      </li>
      <li>3/4 cup creamy peanut butter (such as Skippy)</li>
      <li>
        8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1 tablespoon pieces, divided
      </li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) box rice cereal squares (such as Rice Chex)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon powdered sugar</li>
      <li>8 cups miniature marshmallows (from 2 [10 ounce] packages)</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter (such as Skippy)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Place chocolate chips, 3/4 cup peanut butter, and 4 tablespoons butter
        in a large microwave-safe heatproof bowl. Microwave on HIGH until melted
        and smooth, stirring every 30 seconds, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes; stir in salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cereal into a very large bowl. Pour melted chocolate mixture over
        cereal; fold until cereal is evenly coated. Let rest for 15 minutes.
        Rinse and dry bowl used to melt chocolate mixture and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 cup powdered sugar to cereal mixture; fold until evenly coated
        (itâ€™s ok if some powdered sugar dissolves). Spread into an even layer on
        a large-rimmed, parchment-lined baking sheet and set aside. Rinse and
        dry bowl used to coat cereal mixture and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place remaining 4 tablespoons butter and marshmallows in reserved large
        bowl. Microwave on HIGH until marshmallows have puffed and start turning
        into one mass, about 45 seconds. Stir well and add 2 tablespoons peanut
        butter. Microwave for 30 more seconds, and stir again until smooth.
        Place cereal mixture back into reserved very large bowl and pour
        marshmallow mixture over cereal. Quickly fold and stir until evenly
        coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spray a 13-x 9-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Spread cereal mixture
        into pan, lightly pressing into an even layer; let sit at room
        temperature until set, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift remaining 1 tablespoon powdered sugar over cereal mixture, cut into
        12 (3-x-3.25- inch) pieces and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
